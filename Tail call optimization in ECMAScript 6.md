ECMAScript 6 offers tail call optimization, where you can make some function calls without growing the call stack. This blog post explains how that works and what benefits it brings.

### 1. What is tail call optimization?
To understand what tail call optimization (TCO) is, we will examine the following piece of code. Iâ€™ll first explain how it is executed without TCO and then with TCO.

```js
function id(x) {
    return x; // (A)
}
function f(a) {
    let b = a + 1;
    return id(b); // (B)
}
console.log(f(2)); // (C)
```
